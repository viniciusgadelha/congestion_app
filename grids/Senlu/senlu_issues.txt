hour 2154,  we remove tarrega lleida, increases load montblanc vandellos (?)  


4030-4032 = also disable tarrega-lleida, increases load montblanc but only a little


5665-5667 = also disable tarrega-lleida, doesnt change load montblanc vandellos



hour 8110-8112
removing tarrega-igualada changes a lot of loading but shouldn't since there is nothing connect there.



doesn't converge when removing nuclear power plant in some hours.



adding the third line (igualada something), and adding the renewables generator on Lleida, it creates voltages instabillity on buses 13/2 (tarrega).

with renewables on, removing nuclear add a lot of voltage instabillity.

removing tarrega-lleida with renewables doesn't converge.
